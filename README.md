# Chest X-Ray Image Pneumonia classification
***

Classification of x-ray images from different patients. The dataset contains the classes:
- Normal
- Virus
- Bacteria

This project will classify the images with a trained CNN model. To execute it, download the code and run the Main.py script. It will
download the alredy curated (by me) dataset from OneDrive. The original dataset can be found in: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

After download the dataset, it will ask to provide a name for the model to train/load. the saving extension is added by code, just add the name you would like for this model and it will automaticaly save it with its training history.
the code will continue the main() script unless stopped. The parameters already set on the code are the best model parameters choosen by me after experimenting with it, but you can change the parameters as you like!

The required libraries for the code to run are listed in the requirements.txt document.

Thank you for checking my work! I am open for any suggestion to improve it!
